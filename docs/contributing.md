# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Code Style & Linting
- All code **must pass the included linters and formatters** (ESLint, Prettier, ruff, Black, etc.).
- Linting and formatting are **not optional**â€”your code must conform to the standards enforced by the project tooling.
- There is no additional style guide beyond what is enforced by these tools.

## How to Contribute
- All contributions should be made via **pull requests (PRs)** to the `main` branch.
- Each PR should be focused, clear, and well-described.
- PRs will be reviewed for code quality, correctness, and adherence to project conventions.

## Testing
- **All changes must include appropriate tests** (unit, integration, or E2E as relevant).
- PRs without tests will not be accepted unless there is a clear justification.
- Run all tests locally before submitting your PR to ensure nothing is broken.

## Getting Started
- See the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) and [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) docs for setup and workflow instructions.
